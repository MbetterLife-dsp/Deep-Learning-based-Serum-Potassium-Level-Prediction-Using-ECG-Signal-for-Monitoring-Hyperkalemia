# Background

### Hyperkalemia

* Hyperkalemia can affect the heart rhythm, which can eventually lead to heart failure.
* Hyperkalemia is defined when SPL is above 5.5mEq/L.
* Hyperkalemia is a clinical abnormality frequently seen in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD).
  * Increased number of CKD patients.

### ECG Changes in Hyperkalemia

* The SPL causes deformities of the ECG pattern
  * ECG changes of hyperkalemia

### Purpose of this research

* Patients with CKD often do not detect abnormalities in the heart rhythm until they reach the emergency room.
* Deep learning model for SPL prediction using ECG is proposed.
* Compact deep learning model can warn hyperkalemia to CKD patients in compact system.

### Electrocardiogram (ECG) input to the deep learning model

1. Digitalization process of ECG 
  * 1-dimension ECG waves are extracted through image processing from 12-lead ECG images measured in hospital machines.

2. Digitalization process of ECG   
  * ECG morphologies are detected for extraction of one-cycle ECG.
  * In order to observe changes in the ECG dependent to hyperkalemia, normalization and synchronization of R-peak are performed.

### Deep learning model for serum potassium level prediction

* Depthwise separable convolutional neural network (DSCNN) is method to build light weight deep neural network.
* DSCNN factorize a standard convolution into a depthwise convolution and pointwise convolution.
  * Comparison of structure

* Deep Learning Model for SPL Prediction
* We adapted CRNN model based on a depthwise separable convolution kernel together with LSTM.
  * Depthwise separable convolutional recurrent neural network (DSCRNN) identify morphological deformations of ECG.
  * DSCRNN reduce the trainable parameters of CRNN.
    * Structure of deep learning model for SPL prediction.

# Experiment results

* Datasets
  * ECGs from CKD patients with an average age of 73 years were recorded at Wonju Severance Christian Hospital from 2009 to 2019.
  * 1,879 ECGs of the CKD patients were used for the experiment.
    * Summary of the ECG datasets of CKD patients

* Experiment for ECG Lead Selection
  * Precordial leads : V1, V2, V3, V4, V5 and V6 were used for SPL prediction performance
    * For performance evaluation, 5-fold cross validation was used.
    * The results show that V5-lead has the highest prediction performance.

* SPL Prediction Performance Comparison
  * We compared SPLs prediction performances of FNN, CNN, RNN, CRNN and DSCRNN networks to verify the benefits of DSCRNN network.
  * We also compare the model for the detection of hyperkalemia. (C. D. Galloway et al., 2012)
