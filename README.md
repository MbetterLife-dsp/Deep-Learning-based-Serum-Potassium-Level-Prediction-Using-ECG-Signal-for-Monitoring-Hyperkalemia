# Background

### Hyperkalemia

* Hyperkalemia can affect the heart rhythm, which can eventually lead to heart failure.
* Hyperkalemia is defined when SPL is above 5.5mEq/L.
* Hyperkalemia is a clinical abnormality frequently seen in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD).
  * Increased number of CKD patients.

### ECG Changes in Hyperkalemia

* The SPL causes deformities of the ECG pattern
  * ECG changes of hyperkalemia

### Purpose of this research

* Patients with CKD often do not detect abnormalities in the heart rhythm until they reach the emergency room.
* Deep learning model for SPL prediction using ECG is proposed.
* Compact deep learning model can warn hyperkalemia to CKD patients in compact system.
